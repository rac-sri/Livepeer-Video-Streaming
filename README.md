# Livepeer

Livepeer is a decentralized video broadcasting platform powered by a crypto token on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Transcoder

Transcoding is the process of taking an input video in one format and bitrate, and converting it into many formats and bitrates to make it playable on the majority of devices on the planet at any connection speed.

In The Livepeer network, nodes who play the role of transcoder, perform this very important function, and as a result itâ€™s important that they have high bandwidth connections, sufficient hardware, and reliable devOps practices. These nodes are delegated towards and elected to perform this role, and they are rewarded with the ability to earn fees from the network.

### BroadCaster

On sending video into your broadcaster node and viewing the output transcoded video. In order to see more detailed logs, run your broadcaster with -v 6 to enable verbose logging.

After receiving a stream, your broadcaster will try to connect to a set of orchestrators (ether based on the registered orchestrators on-chain or based on the orchestrators specified using the -orchAddr flag). Your broadcaster might reject certain orchestrators based on their required price or ticket parameters.

#### HLS

#### OBS
